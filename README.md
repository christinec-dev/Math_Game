# Math Mania
I'm back again with the power of my backup pc since my computer is still broken (and game dev is put on hold), and I dived a little deeper into Android development with Java. I made this little math quizzing game from the Full Android 11 Masterclass Course by Oak Academy. In the course, we were only shown how to make the addition part of the game, but I refactored the game to also have options for division, subtraction and multiplication, and it shows you the correct answer upon any wrong guess (which was not part of the course). The entire UI was made by me.

This game has a 60-second timer in which the player needs to solve math sums, from +, -, /, and * and each time they guess wrong, they lose a life, and when guessed correct, they earn points on their score. If the player loses all of their lives, the game ends and they have the option to play again or exit the game. Easy peasy!üòÅ
